# ProyectoTienda
This proyect is about a program scripted in C++ for a market used to administrate the products that the user wants to buy.
It has four different options available in the main menu:
* Select products: this option is used by the client to select the products that he or she wants to buy.
* View cart: this option is used when the user wants to see the products that he decided to add to the cart in the option 1.
* Finish: this option is used when the user is already done selecting products and wants to pay. It also calculates a discount in case he selects at least 10 products.
* Exit: this option is used when the user wants to exit the program.
